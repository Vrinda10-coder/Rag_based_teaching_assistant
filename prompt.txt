I am teaching Javascript in my Sigma web development course. Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

{"title":{"305":"FIRST CLASS FUNCTIONS \ud83d\udd25ft. Anonymous Functions \uff5c Namaste JavaScript Ep. 13","94":"SHORTEST JS Program \ud83d\udd25window & this keyword \uff5c Namaste JavaScript Ep. 5","170":"BLOCK SCOPE & Shadowing in JS \ud83d\udd25\uff5c Namaste JavaScript \ud83d\ude4f Ep. 9","175":"BLOCK SCOPE & Shadowing in JS \ud83d\udd25\uff5c Namaste JavaScript \ud83d\ude4f Ep. 9","116":"The Scope Chain, \ud83d\udd25Scope & Lexical Environment \uff5c Namaste JavaScript Ep. 7"},"number":{"305":"16","94":"06","170":"10","175":"10","116":"08"},"start":{"305":764.586,"94":321.236,"170":427.627,"175":694.932,"116":212.164},"end":{"305":830.02,"94":390.089,"170":496.326,"175":763.707,"116":280.332},"text":{"305":"global scope, but it is created as a local variable, okay? When I say a local variable, if you try to, if you want to access this function inside this function, okay? If you want to access this function inside this function, okay? So suppose if you want to access x, y, z, you can access it over here, right? You can access this function, see, it prints x, y, z and you can access this function over here, but if you try to use it outside like this, it will throw out to be an error where it is, okay? Let's go to console, so it gives you a reference error that x, y, z is not defined, okay? So this is what is called as a name function expression and if you just don't give a name over here, it is like a normal function expression or you might call it as an anonymous function to create a function expression, okay? So something like this. So let me just revert it once again and just remove this","94":"ce global space i am talking about constantly right i am talking about global space global space global space so this global space is nothing but any code you write inside javascript which is not inside a function okay so suppose if i created a var a is equals to 10 this is in global space if i created a function b okay this is inside global space but if i create any variable or function inside any function okay so suppose if we have a var x is equals to 10 over here so this x is not global space otherwise everything you see on the top level is the global space so to make things simplify anything which is not inside any function is the global space that simple okay so whenever you create any variables or functions in the global space what happens see i'll show you something interesting if i refresh the page these variables and functions get attached to that global object okay that global","170":"var even outside because it is in the global scope. So let's see in Latin the action, okay? So if I do a console log of a over here and if I do the console log of all of them, okay? So let's see what happens. So now let me just remove this debugger and see what it prints in the console, okay? Let me just run this again and see. So now it prints the value of a, b, c from this line number five, six and seven, okay? 10, 20 and 30 and it also prints a from here, line number nine. But it cannot access b and it stops the program and it throws an error and it says that reference error b is not defined because b was not in the global scope and if I also put a debugger over here in this console.log line, see when we have finished executing this block, right? So that block scope is gone from the scope now, okay? Now block scope is no longer there in the scope, okay? Now we have moved to the globa","175":"than this b. So this b had a block scope and this b had another scope, okay? So if I go dig deep and put a debugger, let us see how this looks like. So if I run the code, okay, see, now you see something more interesting, right? So now if you carefully observe this scope, right? So we have b in two places, okay? So one is this b which is outside in line number one, this b is this script, okay? It's not even in the global, okay? It is in the script which is outside of the block, okay? And one b which is in the block scope, okay? So now here we have three type of scopes. First is the global scope where these var attaches, right? This global object where this var is attached, this a is attached over here. And another are these separate memory space, remember, where latent const were hoisted and put in a separate memory space, right? So that is this script space, okay? And we also have a sco","116":"efined so here comes scope into picture now i'll tell you the easiest definition of scope okay so scope means where you can access a specific variable or a function in our code okay that is scope see there are two aspects to it i'll tell you both so first is what is the scope of this variable okay so what is the scope of this variable b that means where can i access this variable b okay that is scope and the other way of seeing it is is b inside the scope okay so when i say is b inside the scope of function c so that means can i access this b inside c so there are two ways to look at it first is what is the scope of a variable b and one is is b inside the scope of a function so so so people use it in different ways but it's like almost the same thing and as i told you in the beginning of the video scope is directly dependent on the lexical environment okay now let us see what is lexical"}}

"what is global scope variable "
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
